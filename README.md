# CMPG-323-Overview-33448809
This repo contains all the info on my project for my Portfolio of Evidence (POE)

## Which repositories will be created and used:

	The overview repository will be used as for all the projects of my POE.
	
## Project and repository context and how they are integrated:

	There will be one repository with 5 Projects.
	All project will be linked to the overview repository which would have all the labels and milestones. Please see the diagram below.

## Branching strategy to be used:
	
	I will be using a simple branching strategy since i will be the only person working on the projects.
	The branching strategy will have a main branch and when ever i need to make change i will create a feature branch for the changes.
	Once the changes are made i will create pull request to merge the changes with the main branch and delete the feature branch.
	Below is a diagram on how the branching strategy will be working:

## The used of a .gitignore file within my projects

	Is to ensure that certain files are not being tracked by Git remain untracked.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information

	Never keep critical information or passwords on GitHub.
	When branches are merged and forked, the risk of a data or infrastructure intrusion grows rapidly. 
	The simplest way to reduce this risk is to avoid storing passwords and sensitive data in code before committing to a branch.
