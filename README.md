## The used of a .gitignore file within my projects
	Is to ensure that certain files are not being tracked by Git remain untracked.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information

	Never store credentials and sensitive data on GitHub
	The issue of a potential data or infrastructure breach can increase exponentially when branches are merged and forked. The easiest method to mitigate this risk 	is not to store credentials and sensitive data in the code before committing to a branch.
