## The used of a .gitignore file within my projects

	Is to ensure that certain files are not being tracked by Git remain untracked.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information

	Never keep critical information or passwords on GitHub.
	When branches are merged and forked, the risk of a data or infrastructure intrusion grows rapidly. 
	The simplest way to reduce this risk is to avoid storing passwords and sensitive data in code before committing to a branch.
